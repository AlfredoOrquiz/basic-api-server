# basic-api-server

## Live Deploy
[Heroku](https://alfredo-basic-api-server.herokuapp.com/)

## Deployment

Your server must be deployed at Heroku.
If it requires a database, provision it.
For APIs, your endpoints should all be testable remotely using an HTTP REST client.
For Web Servers, your website must be reachable.

How do I install the app or library? Clone this app and install all dependencies.

How do I test the app or library? Run "NPM test" in the terminal once all dependencies are installed.

For Applications: How do I run the app? Run nodemon or node (whatever file you have the start in. In my case it is index.js) How do I set up the app? I set up the app with Heroku

## Testing

Write a complete set of tests for all data models, independent of the server
Use an in-memory SQL dialect to test your Postgres Models.
For testing the server and routes, make sure you initialize the database before your tests run.
What weâ€™re testing is not whether express works, but whether your routes are doing the correct things.
Your tests must be running green on Github Actions.
